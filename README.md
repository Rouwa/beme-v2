# What problem does this project try to solve?  
Our intention was to simplify the process for students to manage their studies and career development. BeMe aims to provide a platform where students can manually record their learnings and experience , as well as any important dates. BeMe will then curate the user’s manually recorded data into an online portfolio, which can be shared as a resume. As the final feature in the first ‘demo’ , user’s are then able to connect with their mentors (references) and other students (collaborations).  Our goal is to help students build on their skills and portfolio for the industry.
